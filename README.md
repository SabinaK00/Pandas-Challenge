# Pandas-Challenge
Pandas Data Manipulation 
I was tasked with analyzing district-wide standardized test results, aggregating the data to showcase trends in school performance. This involved analyzing school datasets, conducting comprehensive data analysis, and reporting on various aspects of school performance. I utilized Pandas DataFrames to create and manipulate data, analyzing both school and standardized test data. Each section required detailed computation, aggregation, and visualization of data to derive meaningful insights and draw conclusions.
